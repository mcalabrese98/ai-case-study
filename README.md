# Meet Mason, an AI Start-Up Leading the e-Commerce Industry

Founded in 2017 by Barada Sahu and Kausambi Manjita<sub>5</sub>, Mason is a for-profit tech start-up company hailing from the Bay Area California. If Mason doesn't _immediately_ strike a chord with you, you may also know them as ModeMagic, Getmason, or even Mason.io. The idea for "Mason" sparked to life when a more recent problem plagueing small-to-meidium sized online retailers came into play: behemoth platforms _(Yes, **Amazon**, we're looking at you)_ charging increasingly high listing (or commission) fees, as well as limiting control for smaller brands utilizing their platforms. With this problem becoming more evident as many new businesses emerge, Mason gained attention from several funding companies, such as: Lightspeed Venture Partners, Accel Partners, Ideaspring Capital & others. In their second round of seeding, Mason has raised an astonishing **_$7.5 million_** in funding<sub>7</sub>. 

The specific problem Mason aims to solve is by providing a seller's online platfrom with AI design plug-ins & other AI tools to help boost product recommendations and increase sales. A quote directly from Manjita states: 
>“We are changing the game,” said Manjita. “Most brands are left with no option but to sell at marketplaces like Amazon and pay 35c for every dollar simply because running a profitable standalone direct-to-consumer store is just too hard. By democratising access to a complex tech stack, from data-driven merchandising, to sales automation, to personalisation, we are helping more entrepreneurs to stay independent.”

A few examples of this include: AI Product Reccomender Quizzing to direct customers to the item that is the right fit for them, Pop-Up "games" that can provides shoppers with a chance to win discounts, and promotional tools such as "Back in Stock, Coming Soon, or New Arrival" & even "Top Seller" banners for hot items<sub>6</sub>. Mason's current target demographic for it's customer base is small to medium size e-commerce businesses who currently use large "resale" platforms such as Amazon, or even Walmart, to sell their products<sub>4</sub>. The solution that Mason offers that tech behemoths like Amazon can't (and quite frankly, _don't care to_) is by providing 'a nocode, headless content-toolkit that powers commerce content across distributed storefronts. This in turn eliminates the 24/7 operations needed to run shopping experience across all channels, which is typically required by other platforms.' <sub>1</sub> The current tech stack behind the powerful tool that is Mason includes: HTML5, Google Analytics, and Google Tag Manager, Viewport Meta, Euro <sub>3</sub>. From the relatively deepdive I did on Mason, I could only pull a few items on their tech stack. A lot of their information seems to be paywalled behind certain sites like "Crunchbase", which may point to them using more complicated tech that they prefer _not_ to be public information. 

Now, if we were to take a step back and look more broadly at Mason, we can clearly see that they are in the Retail Industry, but more specifically, the e-Commerce sector. There have been major changes and trends in the past 5, or even 10, years in this sector. Companies like Amazon have emerged as frontrunners, & taken over the land by storm. One could even go as far as using the term _"blitzkrieg"_, for how quickly they have attacked their competition. The trends over the past decade has been moving retail products from a physical outlet, to an online location such as the specific companie's website, or a 3rd part retailer such as Best Buy, Wal-Mart, or Amazon site. Of course, these items can still be found in stores, but adding them to the online catalog has proven to bring back numbers unseen in the decades prior. Other Major companies in this industry include, but are not limited to: Target, Alibaba, & eBay.

The business impact that Mason has had for clients is made quite evident. They boast their impacts by providing case studies on their website from clients who have successfully integrated Mason into their online store. Many of these customers typically boast between 5-15% (some even _up to 30%_) increases in revenue. These increases come from Mason's powerful tools such as it's "abandon cart" reminders, and it's AI powered reccommendation programs to help pinpoint specific products that fit the customers individual needs. Typically, core metrics used to identify success in this industry would be: Average order value (AOV), Conversion rate (CR), & Return rate (rerun customer rate basically). My company is performing well in this category, with customers seeing rises in all core metrics. Compared tp their competitors, Mason is fairing quite well. They have received _multiple_ awards, such as "Top Tech Startups In Canada", "Top Conversion Optimization Startups In North America" <sub>8</sub>, &  even being named one of the "Top e-commerce startups On Earth" via [Wellfound](https://wellfound.com/company/mason-io).

As you can tell, Mason is doing _quite_ the job in their sector. If I were to offer ANY advice, or provide sugesstions, the one thing I could suggest is: integrate some sort of service where they can promote the e-commerce plug-ins (such as the Pop-Up games) on Social media for an extra 5% discount! Imagine, the site you like has an "up to 20% off" discount wheel... if you could share this to, say, Facebook, not only are you promoting the discount to your friends who are looking for similar products, but you also get an extra 5% off just for sharing that. ONE CLICK! Extra 5% off. Do the Math. It's a no-brainer. Providing this extra tool could boost traffic to the website exponentially, and with the current solutions they offer, they could boost sales even further with their already proven methods. As we all know, more traffic = more opportunity to drive growth. Mason would most likely have to utilize social sharing technologies such as plugins, or sharing buttons from the respective social media sites. Tying that in with the e-commerce sites discount code/coupon pages could provide for a relatively easy change, yet return a hefty boost in AOV or RR. These technologies are appopriate for my solution because they are easy to integrate, provide the company with the opportunity to maximize traffic which in return can boost profits, and on-top of that, these sharing solutions are often welcomed by social media sites as it drives traffic to their site as well. It becomes a symbiotic relationship between both parties.
